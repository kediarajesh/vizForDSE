Description: 

This is a python based visualization tool which can do generic plotting of data present in csv files. We hope this to be useful when you don't want to write a script to plot the data and want to observe the behavior of the data first.

There are various help documents prepared to help the users understand the interface of the tool.

2. Extract the tarball and put it in a folder named eclipse in the same directory as this repository
3. Edit eclipse/bin/x86_64_linux/eclipse according to your directory structure
4. Open the example_fields_for_tool.csv file
5. Open the generate constraints file
6. Put in the necessary constraints and click on generate. Wait for a little time as the tool takes time to run.
7. Open generated.csv created in the vizForDSE folder to see the csv for plotting.
